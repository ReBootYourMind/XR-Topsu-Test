# XR-Topsu-Test
Testing Niantic SDK with unity

# Goals
- Make a mobile game that uses camera based cross reality
- It should use Niantic SDK
- One player can hide virtual items in the real world that other player needs to find
- Most likely just a toggle between hide/search
- Item is only visible from close by

# If time:
- Support for multiple devices
- Send invite to your friend to find 
- sparkle for the item from medium distance
- sonar ping pulse that will show if there is anything hidden nearby/far
